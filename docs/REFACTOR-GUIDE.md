# 🚀 Agent Refactor Complete!

The agent has been fully refactored to use Cloudflare Agents SDK best practices with the Vercel AI SDK.

## ✅ What Changed

### Architecture

-   **Before**: Manual `Agent` class with custom WebSocket handling and manual AI calls
-   **After**: `AIChatAgent` with streaming responses and automatic tool calling

### Benefits

-   ✨ **No more timeouts!** - Streaming responses instead of waiting for complete generation
-   🛠️ **Better tool calling** - Automatic tool execution with built-in confirmation flows
-   📦 **Cleaner code** - 1,374 lines → ~230 lines in agent.ts
-   🔄 **Real-time updates** - Streamed responses appear as they're generated
-   🎯 **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with AI SDK types

## 📋 Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd apps/agent-service
pnpm install
```

This will install:

-   `ai@^4.0.56` - Vercel AI SDK
-   `zod@^3.24.1` - Schema validation for tools

### 2. Check Worker Configuration

The `wrangler.jsonc` should already have:

-   ✅ `ContribotAgent` Durable Object binding
-   ✅ `DB` (D1 database)
-   ✅ `AI` (Workers AI)

### 3. Restart Services

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Agent Service
cd apps/agent-service
pnpm run dev:local

# Terminal 2 - User Application
cd apps/user-application
pnpm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Agent Flow

1. **User sends message** → Frontend uses `useAgentChat` hook
2. **Agent receives message** → `onChatMessage()` method called
3. **AI processes with tools** → Streams response with tool calls
4. **Tools execute** → Auto-execute or require confirmation
5. **Response streams back** → User sees response in real-time

### Tool Confirmation Flow

**Auto-Execute Tools** (No confirmation needed):

-   `suggestIssues` - Find issues
-   `suggestRepos` - Find repos
-   `toggleFavourite` - Save/unsave items
-   `getFavourites` - Get saved items
-   `updatePreferences` - Change settings

**Confirmation-Required Tools**:

-   `forkRepository` - Fork a repo
-   `createBranch` - Create a branch
-   `commentOnIssue` - Comment on an issue
-   `createPullRequest` - Open a PR

When a confirmation tool is called:

1. AI proposes the action with details
2. Frontend shows confirmation UI
3. User approves/denies
4. Tool executes only if approved

## 🔧 Frontend Changes Needed

The frontend needs to switch from `useAgent` to `useAgentChat`:

**Before:**

```tsx
const connection = useAgent({
    agent: "contribot-agent",
    name: userId,
});
```

**After:**

```tsx
const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useAgentChat({
    agent: connection,
});
```

See the updated `chat-interface.tsx` for full implementation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'ai'"

Run `pnpm install` in `apps/agent-service`

### Agent not responding

Check console logs:

-   `[Agent] onChatMessage called` - Message received
-   `[Agent] Starting text stream` - AI processing
-   `[Tool] toolName:` - Tool execution

### Tools not working

1. Check GitHub API client is initialized
2. Verify database connection
3. Check user has GitHub tokens in D1

### Streaming not working

-   Streaming uses Workers AI's Llama 3.3
-   Falls back to single response if streaming unavailable
-   Check `[Workers AI]` logs for generation status

## 🎉 Try It Out!

Send these messages to test:

1. **"Show me TypeScript issues"** - Should suggest issues immediately
2. **"Fork facebook/react"** - Should ask for confirmation
3. **"What are my favorite repos?"** - Should list favorites
4. **"Update my languages to Python and Go"** - Should update preferences

Watch the logs to see:

-   Tool calls being processed
-   Responses streaming
-   Dashboard state updates

Enjoy your new, timeout-free AI agent! 🚀
