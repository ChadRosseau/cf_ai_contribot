# Action Items - Cloudflare Agents Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All code has been written and is ready for testing. Below are the steps you need to take to get everything running.

## 📋 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Rebuild Data-Ops Package ⚙️

New query functions have been added to data-ops that need to be built:

```bash
cd packages/data-ops
pnpm run build
cd ../..
```

**New functions added:**

-   `getFavouritedRepos()` - Get favourited repos with full details
-   `getFavouritedIssues()` - Get favourited issues with full details

### 2. Regenerate Drizzle Schemas (If Needed) 🗄️

If you've made any schema changes or want to ensure everything is up to date:

```bash
cd packages/data-ops
pnpm run db:generate  # Generate migration files
pnpm run db:migrate   # Apply to database
cd ../..
```

**Note:** The schema hasn't changed in this implementation, but it's good to verify.

### 3. Regenerate Cloudflare Types 🔧

The agent service needs updated type definitions:

```bash
cd apps/agent-service
pnpm run cf-typegen
cd ../..
```

This will generate proper types for the `Env` interface and bindings.

### 4. (Optional) Install Additional Packages 📦

**Good news:** No additional packages need to be installed!

-   The `agents` SDK (^0.2.13) is already in package.json
-   All other dependencies are already present

### 5. Test Locally 🧪

#### Terminal 1 - Start Agent Service:

```bash
cd apps/agent-service
pnpm run dev:local
```

You should see:

```
⛅️ wrangler dev --local --persist-to .wrangler/state
⎔ Starting local server...
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8788
```

#### Terminal 2 - Start User Application:

```bash
cd apps/user-application
pnpm run dev
```

**Before starting the frontend:**
Make sure to add the environment variable for the agent service URL:

```bash
# In apps/user-application/.env or as environment variable
VITE_AGENT_SERVICE_URL=localhost:8788
```

### 6. Test the Agent 🤖

Open your browser to the user application and:

1. **Log in** with your GitHub account
2. **Open the chat** interface
3. **Look for** the green "Connected" indicator
4. **Try these commands:**
    - "Hello" (simple chat)
    - "Show me TypeScript issues" (issue suggestions)
    - "Show me Python repos" (repo suggestions)
    - "Fork facebook/react" (confirmation flow)
    - "Update my languages to Python, JavaScript" (preferences)
    - "Remind me in 1 minute" (scheduling)

Expected behavior:

-   ✅ WebSocket connection established
-   ✅ Agent responds in real-time
-   ✅ Confirmation prompts for write actions
-   ✅ Dashboard updates automatically

## 🐛 If You See Errors

### TypeScript/Linting Errors

These are expected until you complete steps 1-3 above. The errors should disappear after:

1. Rebuilding data-ops
2. Regenerating Drizzle schemas
3. Running cf-typegen

**Don't try to fix them manually** - they'll resolve automatically.

## 📞 If You Need Help

### Debugging Tools

    - Check for any errors

2. **Check browser console** (F12)

    - WebSocket connection status
    - Any JavaScript errors

3. **Network tab** in DevTools

    - Look for WebSocket connection
    - Should show "101 Switching Protocols"

4. **Test with wscat**
    ```bash
    wscat -c "ws://localhost:8788/agent/test-user?userId=test-user"
    ```

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect to WebSocket"**

-   Check agent service is running

-   Try `ws://` instead of `wss://` locally

**"GitHub tokens not found"**

-   Log out and log back in
-   Check auth_account table in D1

**"Agent not responding"**

-   Check agent service logs
-   Verify user ID is correct
-   Check D1 database connection
