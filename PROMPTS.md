Read @OVERVIEW.md and @IMPLEMENTATION.md to gain an understanding of this project. Then read @data-service/ , @user-application/ , and @data-ops/ to understand the project structure.

State your understanding of the project and each of its key components.

Ask any questions you may have around the project, and let me know when you are ready to begin creating a feature.

---

1. Option A
2. I have oauth app with authentication already setup for user actions. However, I still need to setup an access token for the background scraping tasks. I will give more details on how we are scraping the repos later on.
3. I have it enabled. Minimize costs where possible, I will set limits in the dashboard.
4. Design the full schema.
5. Build features incrementally and complete phases where possible.

For our first feature, we will be developing the scraping worker that runs a few times a day.

The way we will scrape is by having an adapter pattern for each data source. The input for a data source will be a URL. The output from that source must be a list of objects which contain the following: 
1. repository name (e.g Superset)
2. data source id (e.g "awesome-for-beginners")
3. tag for good first issue (e.g "good first issue")
4. repository languages, array ranked in order of % of repo, with majority language coming first

A centralised system should then process these output objects to compare them with those originally in the database. The idea is to, in the database, store a hash of this information for each row. If the hash has changed, then we know to update that row.

Ask any questions you may have about this process. Do not begin writing code yet.

---

In repos, also store the repo owner (so we can access through github/owner/repo-name)

1. Starting with awesome-for-beginners with its data.json file. Generic URL depending on needs of adapter. Simple config file at this stage.
2. Call github API endpoint. We can store the raw object returned by the endpoint, but this shouldn't be hashed as it can change all the time. The the ordered array should instead be used for the hash. Both can be stored though. Later, in the frontend, we may render language %s in the same way github repos do.
3. Tag change, languages change. No history, just overwrite with new data
4. Same worker run, but also do the storage (for both repos and issues)
Store title, body, state, comment count, created/updated, github issue #, repository id (should be able to get issue joining issue table with repo table, and then doing github/owner/repo-name/issue-#), assignee status. Also hash metadata yes, comment count / state / assignee.

5. We want to avoid duplicates. If a repo is already found by another datasource (same owner and name), ignore

6. Let's do every 6 hours. That execution flow does match vision.

7. Queue for separate worker. It should be implemented for first feature.

8. Hardcode for now.

Refine your understanding accordingly. Generate a detailed implementation plan (but without code), and store it in docs/phase-1.md. Do not write code yet, we will begin this afterwards.


---

AI queue worker should be started after scraper worker finishes. We need to make sure to implement rate limiting to not exceed 5000 req/hr.

Also, for deduplication, only defer to first source if information matches. In the case where a second source has more up-to-date information, use it instead (in case first source has become redundant)

---

Begin. Make sure that for all drizzle-related commands, you use the pnpm scripts instead of running them with npx or otherwise.

---

I have run the generation command myself

---

I will build the ops package. I want the scraping to be done as workflows. Adapt accordingly, there is an example workflow in data-service already.

---

This is the format of the data.json file. Update accordingly. We only care about the 'repositories' field.

Read @https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/#test-cron-triggers and provide instructions for testing the job accordingly

---

Using this documentation, create api endpoints for checking the status of, and stopping, the workflow.

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'SCRAPER_WORKFLOW')

---

I should be able to create it through this command, why doesn't it work:

curl "http://localhost:8787/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled"

---

I get 404 not found

---

I get same error

---

Workflow not found when running remote, do I need to deploy?

---

I want to run the entire workflow logic outside of the workflow to test it. Write API endpoint accordingly.

---

Forbidden, check token validity

---

The scraper token is a github PAT, is this an issue?

---

For now, if the first request fails due to 403 forbidden, do not try any others.

---

This is a sample CURL that works. Make sure the headers match in the code:

curl -H "Authorization: token <token>" https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/languages

I got too many subrequests. Do not exceed 40 requests per minute.

During direct test, also limit to doing issues for 3 repos. Priority is to test entire workflow (fetch repo -> parse repo -> fetch issues for repo -> summarize repos/issues), but only for a small amount. Add a limit to # of processed issues too (maybe 10 per repo). again, only for direct test

---

Implement better error handling so that even if one issue fails, the rest can gontinue

---

I did the build myself

---

Explain to me where AI summaries of issues are stored

---

Where is testing mode enabled/disabled (where the limit is set to 5)

---

Double check that the limits do not apply to the cron-triggered workflow

---

When triggering as cron, what input payload is there

---

process-issues-1 is giving this object, why:
{
  "processed": 0,
  "new": 0,
  "updated": 0,
  "unchanged": 0,
  "errors": 0

---

Add a cloudflare R2 integration that dumps workflow run logs to a JSONL file, as I cannot view console logs on deployed workflows. Include full instructions for what is necessary my side (e.g creating R2 bucket).

Ask any questions you may have. Do not write code yet.

---

1. Option C
2. One file per run
3. B
4. all of those. Do not include api stats or workflow instance id, instance id should be in file name.
5. continue and succeed
6. A
7. Keep forever right now. But make a way (in env) to easily switch off logging to R2.
8. One bucket, private, will all be through cf dashboard so no cors.

---

1. All endpoints + workflow runs
2. no filtering.

Begin coding

---

Do we also have the request rate limiting when fetching repo languages? All requests need to be no more that 40 requests per minute

---

This is the error I'm getting:

---

Double check you've already fully implemented that step, as I paused halfway through.

You will also need to do the same for process-ai-queue

---

Repos also may have many more than two issues, we can't rely on each repo having less than a certain number of issues.

---

Some repos have hundreds of issues. Increase the limit from 1k to 10k for a repo.

---

Are we in any way making sure we don't exceed 6 concurrent requests per worker? Check this

---

add workflow step to jsonl name

---

I am still getting too many subrequests, are you sure doing another "step" counts as a fresh worker?

---

I have a plan to get around this, but it will take some major refactoring.
We will split this service into two smaller services:
1. A 'scraping' service. The sole purpose of this service is to find the repos and issues. It will compare found data with database versions (hashes), update them if necessary, and mark them for reprocessing by service 2. Furthermore, it should prioritize scraping of repos/issues which were scraped the least recently. This service will run infrequently, for now let's say twice a day.
2. A 'processing' service. This service will be responsible for 'processing' of repos/issues. This includes all AI generated content, as well as the external request for 'languages' for a specific repo. It will know to process a repo/issue either by there being missing information (e.g no AI summary yet), or by it being marked for reprocessing by service (1).

There are two architectures I have in mind.
1. If either service starts getting 'failed to fetch due to too many subrequests', it should immediately terminate, and respawn another worker of itself if possible (assuming this new worker gets a new execution context). However, I do not know if this is supported
2. Otherwise, there should be an overarching coordinator worker which receives messages from these two workers when they reach their outgoing request limit and terminate, and spawns another clone of the worker. 

Tell me your thoughts and ask any questions you may have. Do not begin programming yet.

---

Will queues automatically spawn workers/workflows until empty?

1. Only issue metadata available from the batch endpoint of the repo. Then the processor service should query each issue individually.
2. Queue triggered if possible, otherwise frequently via CRON.
3. I think we can get rid of the ai_summary_queue table and instead add a col to both the repos and issues tables for the status.
4. Sort by updated at
5. A if possible, otherwise B
6. process as many as possible until it hits the limit and starts erroring, then terminate.
7. happy to just use workers

Refine understanding and let me know thoughts. Ask any more questions if necessary (not required). Do not code yet

---

1. Try catch (B)
2. Option A
3. Service 1 queues all found issues **if**
a. issue is not in database
b. fetched issue metadata differs from previous metadata.
So option B
2. seems good

additionally, we know that a repo languages_fetch and ai summary will be done at same time, so combine that timestamp.

---

Yes, seems good. A few extra points.

1. Create new service `scraper-service` which is Service 1. Copy all config in terms of wrangler.jsonc, etc from current data-service.
2. Rewrite data-service to be Service 2.
3. Don't worry about testing endpoints at this stage. I will manually trigger scraper-service, which should populate the queue for data-service.
4. Both services should use the r2 logging system we implemented. Include the service name in the log file.

First, write your implementation plan to docs/phase-1-rewrite.md. Do not begin coding yet.

---

A few notes:
Before the services run properly and have all linting errors fixed, I will need to rebuild data-ops, regenerate/migrate the drizzle schemas, and redo cf-typegen. Do not get stuck on trying to fix errors stemming from these, or try to run the commands yourself. I will do them at the end.

The r2 logger, since it is shared, should also be moved into packages/r2-logger as an independent service. Update the md accordingly.

You may begin programming.

---

Module '"../drizzle/schema"' has no exported member 'aiSummaryQueue'.ts(2305)

---

The whole ai-queue file still has errors, as it is using aisummaryqueue

---

How to manually trigger the scraper service?

---

Add http endpoint, but I need it to work for deployed version

---

I notice that in the scraping service, sometimes database writes just fail with "failed query". I believe this is also due to hitting the 50 subrequest limit, since it applies to database operations too. An example is below.

Instead of inserting each issue one by one, can we batch them given we fetch them as a batched endpoint?

Also, if we fail due to this reason, terminate immediately and queue a new worker.

---

The batch insert is failing.

Also, is the scraper service actually consuming when there is a continuation needed? Is it using the queue? Or just doing it itself?

In addition, failed database queries should be gracefully handled, not returned in the response.

---

Is using the same queue a problem? Or are the messages different so its not?

---

Stop sending entire error in response. If it detects it has run out of submessages, it should say so, and queue another worker to run

---

The batch insert still isn't working. Here is the error, cut off a bit. Is the content being improperly escaped? What could be the issue?

params: 93,19912,[iOS/Android][PhoneCallManager] `IsCallActive` & `IsCallIncoming` does not change when user receives or answers a phone call,### Current behavior

When the user receives an incoming call or is actively on a call, the checkboxes for `IsCallIncoming` and `IsCallActive` remain in the false state. They do not reflect the actual call status.

Tested with Versions:
iOS: **2504012147.36782** & **2504091441.36963**
Android: **2504091443.36963 (36963)** & 2504012147.36782 (36782)

### Expected behavior

When the user receives an incoming call, IsCallIncoming should be set to true.
When the user answers the call and it becomes active, IsCallActive should be set to true.
Once the call ends, both flags should revert back to false.

I realised we have an issue where, if the requests start failing, then we cannot talk to continuation queue either.

I also realised that the initial repo search always succeeds. So what we should do is have the following:

1. Service that fetches scrapes repos. Each found repo should be added to a queue if it is (a) not in db or (b) had some change (e.g issue count has changed)
2. Service that consumes repo queue to a. find repo languages and b. find all issues for each repo and c. generate AI stuff for repo, then adds to db. Then adds issues to issue queue
3. Service that consumes issue queue to generate AI stuff for issue, then add to db.

Ask any questions you may have

---

1. option A
2. option A
3. Option B
4. looks good
5/6. Idea is:
- repos are found and put/updated in DB
- repos are queued if new or changed (issue count changed)
- queued repos have ai generation if not already, languages fetched and issues put/updated in DB.
- issues are queued if new or changed
- queued issues have detailed information fetched and ai generation if don't already.

Can figure out a system where data-service does the last 3 points, but using different message payloads to manage which task it is. Since DB update happens before queueing, queue can just contain IDs and data can be fetched from DB otherwise.

---

Proceed with implementation. Keep in mind things like the batch insert limits imposed by D1. Batch queries where possible. Always terminate once failure starts from exceeding subrequests.

At the end, provide a summary of things no longer needed (e.g continuation queue) which I can delete from dashboard.

Change the initial request for # of issues in repo to be confined to the right label ('good first issue') for the repo. This is what should be stored.

Use the graphQL api to do so without fetching all the issues themselves. Here's an example that works:
REQ:
curl -H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"query":"query { repository(owner: \"facebook\", name: \"react\") { issues(labels: [\"good first issue\"], states: OPEN) { totalCount } closed: issues(labels: [\"good first issue\"], states: CLOSED) { totalCount } } }"}' \
     https://api.github.com/graphql
{"data":{"repository":{"issues":{"totalCount":1},"closed":{"totalCount":38}}}}

RES:
{"data":{"repository":{"issues":{"totalCount":1},"closed":{"totalCount":38}}}}

Only need to query for open issues count, not closed, so change accordingly.

In addition, when erroring in either service, be sure to include the repo id / issue id if applicable.

---

I need a way to efficiently detect when the issues I've stored are closed, since we are filtering by "open", so we can update the database as needed and the data is fresh. How can I do this

---

I rebuilt it

Still not updating the connecting state, could it be that the state should be a useState and not just a variable? Same for isProcessing?

---

What model are you?

Can you just use the openai adapter?

---

I did the install. I have also added a OPENAI_API_KEY to .dev.vars

I ran it with "find me some easy typescript issues to work on". It says "suggest Issues" and then dumps this JSON into the output message:

It seems to be trying to call the tool instead, check this interaction

---

The execution should make the frontend navigate to the 'issues' tab and  update with the new results. Is it set up to do this?

---

Do it through a context instead

1. The dashboard has functions to read the database and update its state. This state should also be able to be updated by the AI agent. It is navigating to the tab, but not changing the state of the tab. This should apply to both the repos and issues tabs.
2. It is still dumping the JSON response into the chat. There should be an intermediary step that separates the tool call and chat response. Right now it is just dumping the query output:

{ "issues": [ { "id": 3476, "issueNumber": 1299, "title": "Comprehensions are inferred as Generator not AsyncGenerator when await keyword is used in the condition", ...}

---

Should we be filtering streamed text based on whether it is a tool call or not?

---

These are the streamText docs:
@https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#parameters 

---

Look at the output. There are `toolCalls` and `toolResults` separate to `text`. Update accordingly

---

There are also `steps`. Again, read the link:
@https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#parameters 

Incorporate these

Why are we previewing the stuff here, this is the issue:

even then, we definitely don't show the entire tool output in stringified format. Only use the message and execution.

The part type may not be text, but in this case it should show the tool call message

---

Explicitely read and understand the entire file and fix it. The issue is on line 273.

---

suggestIssues should include a difficulty filter, the same way that recommendedIssues does with the user preference

---

The tool calls should also be able to navigate the pagination. The page state should be shared in the context, so the user can also go to the next page with the same filters

---

The repos tool should also have this same functionality

---

I notice most of the state is still in the dashboard view component, with updates copied from the context. This isn't ideal. The state should live in the context, with both the dashboard and the ai agent (through chat) able to update it. All state should be available in tools. Update codebase accordingly

---

There is a loop, the issues keep reloading

---

Add preview of issue filters if there are filters other than repo (e.g language), with ability to clear. Should be combined with repo filter message.

Also, the pagination stuff doesn't update when the ai sets the issue state. It should update the # of pages, and clicking next page should go to the next page with the filters applied

---

1. I cannot see the page controls when the AI has applied filters
2. Reloading the page should not have the chat reapply filters. That is to say, tool calls from the chat should only be done with new incoming messages, not with previous messages in the chat history

---

Maybe instead, the issue is that the state is saved in the durable object. But clearing filters doesn't inform the object, so when I reload, the loaded state from the DO has the filters still.

We have an issue. If we set the filters as undefined, in updateDashboardState in the agent, it doesn't detect this, as the spread operator will just use that of the original. Either we need to set this to undefined, or we need to update the frontend such that an empty filters object will count as there being no filters (and therefore not render the filters panel), and never have filters be "undefined"

---

Same problem with repoFilter, if I set the repofilter as undefined, it doesn't detect the change. Fix should be in both updateDashboardState in frontend and in agent updateDashboardState

---

During the consolidation of the agent issues state and the frontend issues state, (during state update), (agent.ts lines 320) if the new state object is empty, then it will still keep all the data from the previous state. Need a better way to do this. Is there any reason to not just override the old state with the new?

---

When clearing filters, the query should be rerun with the new filter changes, and the results shown

---

There seems to be a lot of repeated change detection, which is overloading miniflare. Here are the logs. See if you can identify why:

suggestedIssues and suggestedRepos in the backend should instead just reflect 'issues' and 'repos' in local state. They should be updated when the user queries through the UI too.

---

There is a loop of syncing state, it seems that the frontend is constantly syncing state to agent

---

This was the old agent.ts. The 'fetch languages from github' functionality used the agent service to talk to github and process the languages, before sending them back. This functionality is now broken. Update dashboard and onboarding to talk to the new agent service, and update the new agent service to make this functionality available:

---

This fix worked. However, in settings page, whenever changing something (e.g languages or difficulty), it gets immediately overridden again by the original state.

Changes in the settings shouldn't immediately update those settings. It should wait for the user to confirm through the button at the bottom.

---

Toggling the state will stay for a few seconds, then revert.

---

Refactor the settings tab to be in the dashbord/components directory as its own component. It should have its own completely independent state. When opened, it should fetch the current preferences from the database. Changes should be made in local state and when saved, it should query the database to update it.

---

Replace the "loading issues" and "loading repos" text with an actual spinner, the same as the initial page loader, but white

---

center the spinner

---

need min height on container or its too short for it to be centered

---

Read @OVERVIEW.md and @IMPLEMENTATION.md to gain an understanding of this project. Then read@data-service/@scraper-service/ , @user-application/  , and @data-ops/ to understand the project structure.

We have implemented phase 1 of the project. We are moving onto phases 2-4, connecting it to github MCP. Crucially, we do not need to write the MCP ourselves, as an official one exists. Read its documentation at this link:
@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/github-mcp-server/refs/heads/main/README.md 

We will be building using the Cloudflare AI Agents library, in the `agents` npm package. I have prepared detailed documentation of how this works, in @AGENTS.md .

If necessary, we can integrate with the better-auth MCP plugin:
@https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/mcp 

State your understanding of the project and each of its key components.

Ask any questions you may have around the project, and let me know when you are ready to begin development.

---

1. Use remote
2. Option A, with lightweight state
3. Use better-auth wherever possible
4. Yes, do phase 5 alongside
5. new agent-service
6. Only what we need for fork, branch, comment, and other mentioned features in @OUTLINE.md and @IMPLEMENTATION.md . Importantly, we will need to adjust the requested scopes in better-auth to enable these too.

You may begin development. Keep in mind that I will do all drizzle interactions (generate/migrate), and rebuilding of data-ops, do not attempt to do these yourself. Also understand that linter errors due to these steps not yet being done may persist, which can be ignored.

At the end, provide a list of all action items from my side (e.g in cloudflare dashboard).

---

I noticed you have some db querying logic in the user-application api. We want all queries to be explicitely written in data-ops, and then called from other services. Refactor accordingly.

---

You are trying to do db.prepare, you should be using the drizzle ORM methods instead.

---

Also fix the one in getUserGithubTokens, it should use the data ops service, not interact with db directly.

---

Fix linting errors in @users.ts 

---

look at the linting error in setup.ts. the clientid will be provided by ...config.socialProviders?.github, how do I make it build?

---

Update the agent-service and scraper-service to use the same package versions as data-service

---

user-application
error during build:
[commonjs--resolver] Missing "./api" specifier in "@tanstack/react-start" package



---

The new routes are using initDatabase, they should be using getDB instead

---

Rollup failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/slider" from "/Users/rossoc1/Desktop/contribot/apps/user-application/src/routes/_auth/onboarding.tsx?tsr-split=component"

---

I added it

---

Rollup failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/tabs" from "/Users/rossoc1/Desktop/contribot/apps/user-application/src/components/dashboard/dashboard-view.tsx".

---

I added it. Is this using shadcn?

---

Page not found /auth/login. It should trigger the login flow the same way as is done in @github-login.tsx 

Don't need an /auth/login page, just trigger the login flow when the buttons are pressed on landing page

---

Being signed in should render the user's profile in the navbar, the same way as in @navigation-bar.tsx . It should also start the onboarding flow

---

Configure the agent service to actually sit on the agent route. The user application is fetching /api/agent. Double check the configuration and the routes.

---

hook.js:608 Failed to check onboarding status: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
overrideMethod @ hook.js:608
hook.js:608 Failed to scan GitHub: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

I believe I am getting 404s because we are using fetch instead of the proper method for tanstack router. Fix accordingly.

---

It was not hitting the endpoints at all., It is because api routes explicitely require server: { handlers: { syntax. revise routes accordingly.

---

create a basic logo.tsx component that has the logo from public, and put it in the header

---

Use public/logo.svg in the logo component
